	<p>When you select a search result, you will be presented with options to filter your subset using this phenotype or variant INFO column. Phenotype filters apply to study participants directly. If you filter by age less than 50, you will only have participants included in your participants counts and export data that match that filter. Variant INFO columns apply to variants that are used to filter patients. In order for a participants to be included, it must match ALL of the Phenotype filters that you have created as well as have at least one variant that matches ALL of your variant INFO filters.</p>
